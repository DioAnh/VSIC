            "2": "Hey {name}! Look at this, it's hilarious. Mai told me she likes Trung, so I made this funny post about them being the 'new school couple'.",
            "3": "You look at the phone and see a photo of Mai and Trung, edited with hearts around them. You then see Mai further down the hall, looking upset.",
            "4": "(From a distance) Why is everyone looking at me and laughing...?",
            "5": "Mai clearly didn't know about the post and seems hurt. An thinks it's just a harmless joke. This is a tricky situation.",
